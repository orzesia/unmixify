This is a capstone project exploring **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** for blind source separation.  
The goal is to understand how ICA works, implement it in Python, and compare its performance with other unsupervised learning techniques.

In this repository you will find two Python files, "Code Implementation - ICA.py" and "Code Implementation - PCA.py", which encode for the ICA and PCA respectively. To run each file you must set your working directory accordingly. Both files are to be used with the dataset provided under "ECG_dataset". Each script is annotated and commented.

"Code Implementation - ICA.py" will produce two plots, one which plots ICA 1-5, and one which plots ICA1 against R-peaks.
"COde Implementation - PCA.py" will produce two plots, one which plots PCA 1-5, one which plots PCA1 against R-peaks.
